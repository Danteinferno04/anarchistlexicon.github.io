Muh Roads: A libertarian counter-argument often used in arguments concerning public infrastructure.  The mistaken assumption of the statist it is uttered against is that only a coercive government is capable of building and maintaining roads and other "natural public utilities"... whatever the fuck that means.

> But... Muh Roads!

Although the retort itself seves little to further the debate, it does help to point out the absurdity of the argument.

Let's talk about toll roads. Most people hate them because you have to stop and pay fees in exchange for the privelege of driving on them.

But where does the money for these magical "free" government built roads come from? According to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, it costs about [$1 million per lane per mile](http://www.artba.org/about/transportation-faqs/faqs/#20) in rural areas.

Now construction companies aren't out there building roads out of the goodness of their hearts... No, [TANSTAAFL](/taanstaafl), they're getting paid by state governments who recieve subsidies from the federal government. Governments cannot materialize money out of thin air (actually, that too is a lie, but we'll save that for another post), so any money they have must come from taxes.
